This project implements a **Student Record Management System** that allows efficient searching of student records using **Binary Search Algorithm**.  
The records are sorted by Roll Number before searching.

- **Binary Search** – used to find a student in logarithmic time.
- **Sorting** – ensures that the binary search works correctly.
